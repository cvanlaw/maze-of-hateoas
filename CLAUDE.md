These all *must* be followed:
* Use Test Driven Development (TDD) **ALWAYS** write tests first
* Adhere to the tenets of the Pragmatic Programmer
* The system must be designed according to the 12-factor APP
* Adhere to the SOLID principle
* Builds, tests, etc should be run in a container rather than locally
